            <p>
              The ideal that inspires me and gives me passion for the engineering profession is the
              opportunity to shape a future where stakeholders and the greater community thrive. I
              envision a world where engineering innovations drive sustainable solutions, inclusive
              technologies, and societal progress. By leveraging our skills, we can create positive change
              that benefits all stakeholders and serves the common good.
              <br/><br/>
              To appeal to others, I use this quote “Engineering is the closest thing to magic that exists in
              the world”. Visual images of collaborative engineers building unique solutions and evoke
              unity and the potential for collective achievement. Through this vision, I aim to inspire others
              to join the engineering profession, embrace our shared ideals, and contribute to a better
              future for all.
